/// Tangent Line Between Circles

/**
    Finds tangent segments between two given circles.
    Returns an empty, or 2x1, or 4x1 list of segments representing
    the two exterior and two interior tangent segments (in that order).
    If some tangents don't exist, they aren't present in the res.
    Each segment is represented by the two end points.
    Exterior tangents exist if one of the circles doesn't contain
    the other. Interior tangents exist if circles don't intersect.
    In the limiting case when circles touch from outside/inside, there are
    no interior/exterior tangents, respectively, but just one common
    tangent line (which isn't returned at all, or returned as two very
    close or equal points by this code, depending on roundoff -- sorry!)
    Note: If you need the tangent from a point to a circle,
    just make the radius of one circle zero(it becomes a point then).
